![Mod Banner](link/to/your/banner/image.png)

This is an enhanced version of the "Call for Trial" mod originally created by [Original Author](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199180090097). The original mod can be found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2898554396&searchtext=call+for+trial).

## Overview

The "Call for Trial" mod enables players to call vassals and court members to trials in front of the law. It also introduces a new court position called Justiciar, which decreases monthly tyranny based on aptitude.

### Original Features by Mod Author

- **Calling Vassals to Trials:**
  - To call a vassal or a court member to a trial, you need someone as a Justiciar, with higher diplomacy being advantageous. Your realm must also be feudal.
  - The vassal's agreement to the trial (based on their personality) or imprisonment may be required.
  - Vassals can be called to trial for crimes like attempted kidnapping, murdering close kin, deviancy, rebelling, etc., in line with the user's faith.
  - If the vassal wins the trial, their crimes are forgiven; if you win, you decide their fate.

- **Demanding a Trial:**
  - When imprisoned by your liege, you can demand a trial.

- **Trial by Combat:**
  - When called for trial or when demanding it, a new option allows you to demand a trial by combat. Exercise caution, as it can be fatal. Select a Personal Champion if you lack family protection.

- **Compatibility:**
  - The mod is compatible with everything and is save game compatible.

- **Inspiration:**
  - The mod was heavily inspired by the CK2 AGOT Trial feature, with credit to the AGOT team.

- **Other Mods:**
  - Check out [Original Author's other mods](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2966612217).

## Changes Made

In addition to the original features, this enhanced version incorporates the following changes:

1. **Removed Tribal Limitations:**
   - The mod originally had limitations related to tribal mechanics. My changes removes those limitations, allowing for a broader application of the trial system.

2. **Courtiers Can Be Called to Trial:**
   - In the original version, only landed courtier could be summoned to trial. My modification expands the scope to include unlanded courtiers, providing more flexibility in managing legal affairs within the realm.

3. **Reduced Trial Cooldown to 1 Month:**
   - The cooldown period for initiating trials has been reduced from the original duration to one month. I just didnt like waiting 10 years tbh

## Installation

1. Download the latest version of the mod from the [Releases](link/to/releases) page.
2. Extract the contents into your game's mod directory.
3. Enable the mod in the game's launcher.

## Compatibility
